        <li>Tablespoon of Butter.</li>
        <li>Your choice of Rump Steak.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mash</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of potatoes, peeled and cut in half.</li>
        <li>50ml whole milk.</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of butter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mushrooms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li>A dash of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>500g of chopped mushrooms.</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced.</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    
    <h3>Steak</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steak from packaging, place onto a plate and salt and pepper liberally. Leave to stand at room temperature for half an hour.</li>
        <li>Pat dry with paper towel, salt and pepper again. Heat a cast iron pan on a high heat.</li>
        <li>When the pan starts smoking, add beef tallow and butter -It should melt almost instantly. Place your steak in the pan.</li>
        <li>I advise 2 minutes a side for medium rare, 2 and a half for medium, and 3 for well done.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes. I find wrapping it in tinfoil with garlic and butter to be <b>delicious.</b></li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Mash</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and chop 500g of potatoes, then place into boiling water.</li>
        <li>Boil potatoes until you can stick a knife in them with no resistance, then drain and place back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Add your milk and butter, and start mashing the potatoes. If you want them creamier, feel free to add more.</li>
        <li>When there are no lumps, Serve.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Mushrooms</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop 500g of Mushrooms, then place into a hot frying pan.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil, then fry with your added garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>When the mushrooms are your desired doneness, Serve.</li>
    </ol>
